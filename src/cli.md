# CLI

The CLI can be accessed with either `entropy-script` or `jses` commands.
Note that `jses` is used where either could be used.

Start the REPL with `jses`.
Type `exit` to exit the REPL.

```
jses [script] [args]
```

The most common use case is, of course, a simple invocation of a script:

```
jses myscript.es
```
